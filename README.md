# Python Data Analysis with PyBank and PyPoll

## Background
It's time to transition from Excel sheets to the world of programming with Python. This challange involves completing two Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks simulate real-world scenarios where Python scripting skills are invaluable.

### PyBank Instructions
In this challenge, you're tasked with analyzing the financial records of a company using a Python script. You will be provided with a financial dataset named `budget_data.csv`, comprising two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". Your Python script should perform the following analyses:
- Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset
- Determine the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Compute the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and calculate the average of those changes
- Identify the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- Identify the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### PyPoll Instructions
In this challenge, you're tasked with modernizing the vote-counting process for a small, rural town using Python. You will be provided with poll data named `election_data.csv`, comprising three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your Python script should perform the following analyses:
- Calculate the total number of votes cast
- Compile a complete list of candidates who received votes
- Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
- Determine the total number of votes each candidate won
- Identify the winner of the election based on popular vote

Completing these challenges will demonstrate your ability to handle real-world data analysis tasks using Python, showcasing its advantages over traditional Excel-based analysis.
